<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in creating responsive and user-friendly websites.
   Although I'm at the beginning of my journey, I’m passionate about learning how the web works and turning ideas into functional digital experiences.
   My focus is on building a solid foundation in both design and development, with a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve been working with core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m exploring frameworks such as React and Tailwind CSS to enhance my front-end development skills.
   I’ve completed several small personal projects and practice exercises that have helped me understand the structure, responsiveness, and interactivity of modern websites. 
   I'm also learning Git and version control to collaborate more effectively.</p>

<p>My goal is to grow into a professional developer by building real-world projects and working with others in collaborative environments. 
  I’m currently open to internship opportunities, entry-level roles, or freelance tasks that will allow me to apply what I’ve learned while continuing to grow. 
  I bring curiosity, discipline, and a willingness to learn from every experience.</p>
